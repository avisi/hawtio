### Connect

The Connect tab allows you to connect to local and remote Jolokia instances so you can examine JVMs.

The "Remote" sub-tab is used to manually add connection details for a Jolokia instance.  You can store connection details and quickly recall the details of a connection and connect.

The "Local" sub-tab lists local JVMs running on your machine and allows you to install the Jolokia JVM agent into a running JVM and connect to it.

For this to actually work you need to have your JDK's "tools.jar" in the classpath, along with Jolokia's JVM agent jar.
